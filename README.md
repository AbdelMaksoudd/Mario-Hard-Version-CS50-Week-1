# Mario-Hard-Version-CS50-x-Week-1-
This is my first time working with the C language.  The project prints two mirrored pyramids (like in Super Mario Bros), with a height defined by the user. Built as part of Harvardâ€™s CS50 course using loops, conditions, and the cs50.h library for input handling. A small but important step in my programming journey.
