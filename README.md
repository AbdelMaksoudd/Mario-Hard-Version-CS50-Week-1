# Mario-Hard-Version-CS50-x-Week-1-
This is my first time working with the C language.  The project prints two mirrored pyramids (like in Super Mario Bros), with a height defined by the user. Built as part of Harvardâ€™s CS50 course using loops, conditions, and the cs50.h library for input handling. A small but important step in my programming journey.

How It Works:
- The user is asked to input a number between `1` and `8`.
- The program prints two pyramids (with a gap of two spaces between them), each of height equal to the user's input.

To compile and run this program, you'll need:
- A C compiler
- The `cs50.h` library  
  *(Or run it in [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io)* where it's pre-installed.)
